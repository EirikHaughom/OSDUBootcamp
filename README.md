# OSDU Bootcamp

## Introduction
This repository contains the material for the OSDU Bootcamp. The bootcamp is a hands-on workshop where you will learn how to use the OSDU platform. The bootcamp is divided into modules, each module contains a set of exercises that you will complete. The exercises are designed to give you a basic understanding of the OSDU platform and how to use it.

## Preparations
Please perform these preparations **before attending the bootcamp**, this will ensure that you can get the most out of the bootcamp and avoids spending time on installing and configuring software.

### 1. Install OSDU CLI
The OSDU CLI is a command line tool that allows you to interact with the OSDU platform. It is used to ingest data, create and manage data partitions, and more. The CLI is available for Windows, Linux and MacOS. Please follow the instructions in the [OSDU CLI documentation](https://community.opengroup.org/osdu/documentation/-/blob/master/docs/using-cli.md) to install the CLI.

### 2. Install Postman
Postman is a tool that allows you to interact with REST APIs. It is used in the bootcamp to interact with the OSDU APIs. Please follow the instructions in the [Postman documentation](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/installation-and-updates/) to install Postman.

### 3. Import Postman ADME Collection
The Postman collection contains a set of requests that are used in the bootcamp. Please follow the instructions in the [ADME Postman Collection](https://github.com/EirikHaughom/ADME/tree/main/Guides/Postman%20Collection) to import the collection and environment.
